    <h2>Dave McPhilips</h2>
    <p> Dave McPhilips joined the band at a later
        date as a guitarist, joining around 2007
        but apparently he fit into the band
        perfectly. Sadly he announced his departure from
        the band in late 2019 after almost 12 years saying that 
        it was time for change.
