                <p class="homepageparagraph">
                    The dictionary definition of Mountain Biking is "A sport of riding bicycles off road,
                    often over rough terrain, usually using specically designed mountain bikes" but 
                    just like any other sport, the definition may vary from person to person. For 
                    example, professionals and hardcore Mountain bikers would even go as far as 
                    saying its a lifestyle. Here is a video made by the Global Mountain Bike Network,
                    more commonaly known as the GMBN, explaining what Mountain biking is and why 
                    everyone should consider starting it!

              There are many different types of Mountain Biking:

            <p class="homepageparagraph">
                Cross country is a style of mountain biking, probably the most well known due to its appearances at
                the Olympics. It's all about fitness and stamina, with cross-country race courses involving steep 
                climbs and technical descents with features such as rock-gardens, rollers and drops. The courses 
                arenâ€™t as technical as downhill tracks, but riders have to exert maximum effort for the entire 
                duration of the race. XC bikes are commonly hardtail with 130mm suspension forks but full suspension
                are increasing in popularity. The bikes are designed to be as light and effcient.

            <p class="homepageparagraph">
                Downhill Mountain Biking is fairly self explanatory, you start the track at the top of the mountain
                and race down to the bottom, the person who has the fastest time down is the winner. Riders can reach
                up to speeds of 80kph and hit jumps up to 19m long. Downhill bikes are designed specifically for riding
                down the steep tracks. They are full suspension with 200mm of travel in the fork and an aggresive rear shock.

            <p class="homepageparagraph">
                Freeride mountain biking is a variant of downhill riding where riders perform huge jumps, flips and tricks while 
                riding on natural terrain. A common location for freeride competitions is the Zion National Park in Utah, USA.
                To win a freeride competition you need to be creative with your riding, usually the riders can choose their own way 
                down. The bikes that freeriders use would be the exact same spec as the downhill bikes but with the suspension 
                pumped up a little harder.

            <p class="homepageparagraph">
                Slopestyle, closely related to the tricks part of freeride, slopestyle is all about showcasing aerial tricks on courses
                specically designed with huge jumps, drops and berms. The courses closely resemble a scaled up skatepark, the rider with
                the best and most technical tricks has the highest chance of winning. The bikes these riders use are smaller than most other
                styles, theyre light, small, strong, easy to manoeuvre and with enough travel to boost high and land comfortably

            <p class="homepageparagraph">
                Enduro, one of the fastest growing styles of mountain biking, it is the most similiar to how leisure mountain bikers ride outside of
                competition. It's all about long days out on the bike in a mountain location. It involves riding up the mountain abd racing down
                technical descents. The bike used in Enduro is a fullsuspension but with less front travel, usually between 120 and 180mm.

               Although they are simply just bikes, mountain bikes do tend to have a few extra components compared to a standard bike.
               These components can get quite complex. Below is a video explantion made by Ivanhoe Cycles where they explain each component
               on a Mountain Bike.
